Create an usage plan product-visits-usage-plan that allows 100 requests per second from the client, 5 concurrent requests the client can invoke your API and a total of 50000 requests per month.

Create an API key and note down the key.

Attach the API key to the Usage plan.

Under the POST and GET methods, Method Request -> set API Key Required to True

To test this, you need to deploy the API and test from outside the API Gateway i.e. through POSTMAN.

In the "Headers", add the key "x-api-key" and pass the API key.

Without the correct key, you will get "403 Forbidden" error.
