1. In the AWS Console, Go to CloudTrail, provide a name for the trail and an S3 storage location for the trail logs.
You can choose to encrypt the log file, validate the log file etc
Choose "management events" for event type and Read, Write API activity.
This is enough if you just want to log management type read/write information.
If you want email notification, go ahead with the remaining steps below.

2. Create an SNS Topic MyEmailNotificationTopic with valid email id as subscription.

3. Create an EventBridge rule with source service as S3, event type as Bucket-Level API Call via CloudTrail and target as the SNS topic.

4. For testing, in the static website bucket, try removing the bucket policy and you should get an email based on that activity.
